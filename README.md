# l4-jerseyCharities

A WIP codification of the Jersey Charities Law, written in L4 to demonstrate the capabilities of the L4 Domain Specific Language.

The `reference` folder contains the primary and subsidiary legislation that this was based of.

The `thinking` folder contains docs that document the thinking behind the codification approach.

The `docs` folder contains guides and other docs that were created in the process of codification, in a bid to create guides that are useful to both humans, and also large language models. The latter follows the llms.txt format. 

This codification represents a first attempt at codifying the Jersey Charities Law, from the perspective of a lawyer. A draftsperson is likely to codify the law differently, but hopefully this provides a starting point for an approach towards codifying legislation in L4, that works for both lawyers and drafters.

Playing with the tests (in `tests`) is a great way to get started tinkering with the language. It also emulates what are likely to be pertinent when interacting with the legislation, and interpreting it.

To begin seeing how the legislation maps onto the codification, start with the rationalisation doc in `thinking/charities_rationalisation.md`. This is a work in progress, and will be updated as the codification progresses.

You can copy the l4 files, and tests together into the same sheet in our [online-editor](https://jl4.legalese.com) to run it
or clone, build and run the [L4 IDE](https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-ide) and run this L4 code inside [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).


## L4 - Rules-as-code

L4 is an open-source programming language designed by [Legalese](https://legalese.com) to author better
contracts, legislarion, regulation and other rules so that both humans and computers can read and evaluate them.
